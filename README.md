![TileBitTools: A Godot 4 TileSet editor plugin](https://github.com/dandeliondino/tile_bit_tools/blob/0.1.1/assets/header.png)

This plugin saves and applies built-in and user-generated terrain bit templates.

Godot 4.0's new TileSet/TileMap system is powerful and extensible, and has a lot of untapped potential. But setting up terrain tiles (autotiles) can be confusing for new users and laborious for experienced ones.

The goal of this plugin is to assist in fast iterations for experienced users, help users migrating from Godot 3.5 to quickly set up familiar tilesets, and to speed up the learning process and minimize errors for new users.

## To install:
*TileBitTools is currently only available here on Github as a download. It will be submitted to Godot Asset Library in the future.*
1. Go to Code -> download ZIP
2. Copy the `addons/tile_bit_tools` folder to your project
3. Go to Project Settings -> Addons and enable TileBitTools

## To use:
*TileBitTools is still experimental, please back up first.*
1. Select tiles in the bottom TileSet editor
2. Choose a template
3. Assign terrains
4. Click to apply template
